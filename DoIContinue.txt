program that will prompt the user and ask to continue

1) Prompt the user “Would you like to continue?”
2)Get input from the user
3)Check for three things:
	yes – y    			continue/ re prompt/ go to step 1 again
	no – n				exit program
	other -  [anything else]	error message and re prompt/ go to step 1 


Pseudo code:

do
	ask user if they want to continue
	ask for a response
	compare the response to “y” and “n” (ignoring case) 
		if
		 	y- start again with the reprompt
		else if	n- exit program
		else	any other- error message and reprompt
while (response is not n)




Code:

package doicontinue;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DoIContinue {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		//Having the end variable as false and only setting it to true in the case that we want to quit the program means we only need one while loop
		boolean end = false;
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

		//enter the loop and do it once before getting to the conditional while statement
		do{
			System.out.println("Would you like to continue (\"y\"for yes or \"n\" for no)");
			String response = scan.next();
			if (response.equalsIgnoreCase("y")){
			}
			else if(response.equalsIgnoreCase("n")){
				end = true;
			}
			else{
				System.out.println("why you no answer correctly. Try again");
			}

		}while (end ==false);
		System.out.println("I see we are done here... bye then!");

	}

}
